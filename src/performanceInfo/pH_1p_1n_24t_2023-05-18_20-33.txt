Summary: pH is Compute-bound in this configuration
Compute:                                    100.0% |=========|
MPI:                                          0.0% |
I/O:                                          0.0% |
This application run was Compute-bound. A breakdown of this time and advice for investigating further is in the CPU section below. 
As very little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales.

CPU:
A breakdown of the 100.0% CPU time:
Single-core code:                             0.1% ||
OpenMP regions:                              99.9% |=========|
Scalar numeric ops:                           0.4% ||
Vector numeric ops:                           0.0% |
Memory accesses:                             20.7% |=|
The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance.
No time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized.

MPI:
A breakdown of the 0.0% MPI time:
Time in collective calls:                     0.0% |
Time in point-to-point calls:                 0.0% |
Effective process collective rate:            0.00 bytes/s
Effective process point-to-point rate:        0.00 bytes/s
No time is spent in MPI operations. There's nothing to optimize here!

I/O:
A breakdown of the 0.0% I/O time:
Time in reads:                                0.0% |
Time in writes:                               0.0% |
Effective process read rate:                  0.00 bytes/s
Effective process write rate:                 0.00 bytes/s
No time is spent in I/O operations. There's nothing to optimize here!

OpenMP:
A breakdown of the 99.9% time in OpenMP regions:
Computation:                                  4.6% ||
Synchronization:                             95.4% |=========|
Physical core utilization:                   85.7% |========|
System load:                                 85.9% |========|
Significant time is spent synchronizing threads in parallel regions. Check the affected regions with a profiler.
This may be a sign of overly fine-grained parallelism (OpenMP regions in tight loops) or workload imbalance.

Memory:
Per-process memory usage may also affect scaling:
Mean process memory usage:                     943 MiB
Peak process memory usage:                    1.39 GiB
Peak node memory usage:                      10.0% ||
The peak node memory usage is very low. Larger problem sets can be run before scaling to multiple nodes.

Energy:
A breakdown of how the 20.3 Wh was used:
CPU:                                        100.0% |=========|
System:                                   not supported
Mean node power:                          not supported
Peak node power:                              0.00 W
The whole system energy has been calculated using the CPU energy usage.
